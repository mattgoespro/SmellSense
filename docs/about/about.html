          <h1>What is smell training?</h1>
          <p>
            Smell training engages an innate property of the brain known as
            <span style="font-weight: 300">Neuroplasticity</span>: 'the ability
            of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially
            in response to learning or experience or following injury.' -

          <h1>I'm ready to begin my training. What do I do?</h1>
          <p>
            In a training session, a set of four familiar smells (typically
            <span style="color: #f18db0; font-weight: 400">Rose</span>,
            <span style="color: #a0877f; font-weight: 400">Clove</span>,
            <span style="color: #d6e063; font-weight: 400">Lemon</span>, and
            <span style="color: #56af57; font-weight: 400">Eucalyptus</span>)
            are smelled, in turn, for a period of 20-30 seconds, whilst
            mindfully visualizing and remembering how each substance would have
            smelled prior to the smell loss.
          </p>
          <p>Repeat the training twice daily for better results.</p>

            Over how long a period do I need to smell train in order to recover
            fully?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Recovery periods naturally differ from person to person, but
            research suggests that the average treatment would last for ~3
            months.

            Much depends on the underlying cause of your loss of smell and the
            severity thereof. Most people will become aware of positive changes
            within 3 months of starting smell training. Occasionally, it is
            possible that you may regain the smell of a desired scent, but it
            does not feel 'correct'. Do not be concerned -
            <span style="font-weight: 300">
              this is a positive sign that recovery is underway, and that you
              should continue your training as per usual.

            The Smell<span style="color: #2499f0">Sense</span> kit is built
            simply for convenience, and the scents supplied are the most
            effective for retraining, according to most research up-to-date.

            Otherwise, you can make up your own set of scents on which to smell
            train. Be sure to use a set of recognizable smells that remain
            consistently strong over the period of training. Typically, studies
            use a representative substance from each of the 'notes' of smell:
