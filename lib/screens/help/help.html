  <h1 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 200">What is smell training?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    Smell training engages an innate property of the brain known as
    <span style="font-weight: 300">Neuroplasticity</span>: 'the ability of the
    brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to
    learning or experience or following injury.' - <i>Google Dictionary</i>.

  <h1 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 200">
    I'm ready to begin my training. What do I do?
  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    In a training session, a set of four familiar smells (typically
    <span style="color: #f18db0; font-weight: 400">Rose</span>,
    <span style="color: #a0877f; font-weight: 400">Clove</span>,
    <span style="color: #d6e063; font-weight: 400">Lemon</span>, and
    <span style="color: #56af57; font-weight: 400">Eucalyptus</span>) are
    smelled, in turn, for a period of 20-30 seconds, whilst mindfully
    visualizing and remembering how each substance would have smelled prior to
    the smell loss.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    Repeat the training twice daily for better results.
  </p>
  <h1 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 200">
    Over how long a period do I need to smell train in order to recover fully?
  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    Recovery periods naturally differ from person to person, but research
    suggests that the average treatment would last for ~3 months.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    Much depends on the underlying cause of your loss of smell and the severity
    thereof. Most people will become aware of positive changes within 3 months
    of starting smell training. Occasionally, it is possible that you may regain
    the smell of a desired scent, but it does not feel 'correct'. Do not be
    concerned -
    <span style="font-weight: 300">
      this is a positive sign that recovery is underway, and that you should
      continue your training as per usual.

  <h1 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 200">
    I don't have the official Smell<span style="color: #2499f0">Sense</span>
    kit, so am I still able to use this app?
  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 300; padding-bottom: 5px">Yes!</p>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-bottom: 5px">
    The Smell<span style="color: #2499f0">Sense</span> kit is built simply for
    convenience, and the scents supplied are the most effective for retraining,
    according to most research up-to-date.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200">
    Otherwise, you can make up your own set of scents on which to smell train.
    Be sure to use a set of recognizable smells that remain consistently strong
    over the period of training. Typically, studies use a representative
    substance from each of the 'notes' of smell:
  </p>
  <ul style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200; padding-left: 25px">
    <li style="padding: 3px">
      Floral - eg. <span style="color: #f18db0; font-weight: 400">Rose</span>
    </li>
    <li style="padding: 3px">
      Fruity - eg. <span style="color: #d6e063; font-weight: 400">Lemon</span>
    </li>
    <li style="padding: 3px">
      Spicy - eg. <span style="color: #a0877f; font-weight: 400">Clove</span>
    </li>
    <li style="padding: 3px">
      Aromatic - eg.
      <span style="color: #56af57; font-weight: 400"> Eucalyptus</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 200">
    We wish you all the best with your recovery!
