SmellSense is a productivity application used to help regain a sense of smell quickly.

## Long Description

Smell training is a little-known but scientifically proven method of quickly regaining one's sense of smell by utilizing a complex mechanism of the brain called 'Neuroplasticity', instead of waiting for long periods for your smell to naturally return to normal.

This application has been designed to:

    A. Facilitate the process of smell training as an aid to recovery for those suffering the loss of their sense of smell (Anosmia) or an altered sense of smell (Parosmia).
    B. Guide the user through the smell training progress through encouragements and timing.
    C. Maintain a record/diary of your training progress over time.
    D. Provide you with resources to understand what has happened to your smell and how to regain it in a controlled but efficient manner.

We wish you well on your speedy journey to recovery!
